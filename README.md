# File_IO_Operations
This is a Python project that demonstrates various file input/output operations using different modules and libraries. The main file is `main.py`, which contains the following functions:

- `read_text_file()`: This function reads a text file using the built-in `open()` function and prints its content to the console.
- `write_text_file()`: This function writes some text to a new file using the built-in `open()` function and the `write()` method.
- `read_csv_file()`: This function reads a CSV file using the `csv` module and prints each row as a list to the console.
- `write_csv_file()`: This function writes some data to a new CSV file using the `csv` module and the `writer()` function.
- `read_json_file()`: This function reads a JSON file using the `json` module and prints the parsed data to the console.
- `write_json_file()`: This function writes some data to a new JSON file using the `json` module and the `dump()` function.
- `read_excel_file()`: This function reads an Excel file using the `pandas` library and prints the data frame to the console.
- `write_excel_file()`: This function writes some data to a new Excel file using the `pandas` library and the `to_excel()` method.

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the `pandas` library installed on your system. You can install `pandas` using the command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

You can then execute the `main.py` file using the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run all the functions and display the output on the console. You can also modify the file names and the data as per your requirements.
